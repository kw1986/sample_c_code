This sample C code is for demonstrating the coding skill. 

Question 1:
###########
Write a C program that reads the input file (ASCII_DATA_TEST.txt) line by line and write it to an output file.
The reading & writing of input file must follow the steps as below:

i. Create a function "read_record()" for reading of input file. Hint: Use "C" fread() function.
ii. The record being read must be stored into a record structure. Hint: Use "C" struct.
iii. The data being read must be printed out to screen using a function "show_record()".
iv. Each data printed out must then be written out to another file. Hint: Use "C" fwrite function.
vi. Before write data to output, Change each of the record DATAn to MYDATAn.
